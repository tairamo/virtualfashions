                fluctuate while a video is being streamed.

                updated” date stated on the top of this page. Changes will not operate retroactively. The Company will
                try to notify you when it changes this agreement if it can do so in a reasonable manner. But you should

                the end of the trial period. The Company or its payment processor may authorize your payment method
                through various methods, including authorizing it up to approximately one month of service as soon as
                you register. In some cases, your credit card company may reduce your card’s available balance or credit
                limit to reflect the authorization during your trial period. The Company or its payment processor will
                continue to bill your payment method monthly for your membership fee until you cancel.

            <li><strong>Billing</strong></li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
            <li>(a) <strong>Recurring Billing.</strong> By starting your premium membership, you authorize the Company
                or its payment processor to charge your payment method the membership fee in effect when you originally
                signed up and any other applicable charges, such as taxes or possible transaction fees. Your premium
                membership will continue for the length of the initial term you select, and, at the end of your initial
                prepaid term, it will automatically renew for additional prepaid periods of the same length at the rates
                in effect at the time you originally signed up. You must cancel your premium membership before it renews
                to avoid billing of the next term’s membership fees to your payment method.
                <br>
            </li>
            <li>(b) <strong>Price Changes.</strong> The Company may adjust pricing for its service or any components of
                it in any way and at any time, as it may determine in its sole discretion. Any price changes will not
                affect your current membership (including any renewals) unless the Company gives you 30-days prior
                written notice.
                <br>
            </li>
            <li>(c) <strong>Billing Cycle.</strong> The Company or its payment processor will automatically bill your
                payment method at the beginning of the initial term of your premium membership and every 30 days
                afterward until you cancel your premium membership. Membership fees are fully earned on payment.
                <br>
            </li>
            <li>(d) <strong>Billing Disputes.</strong> If you believe that the Company has charged your payment method
                in error, you must notify the Company in writing no later than 30 days after you receive the billing
                statement in which the error first appeared. If you fail to notify the Company in writing of a dispute
                within this period, you waive any disputed charges. You must submit any billing disputes in writing to
                <a href="mailto:support@virtualfashion.io" class="a-underline">support@virtualfashion.io</a> and include
                a
                detailed statement
                describing the nature and amount of the disputed charges. The Company will correct any mistakes in a
                bill and add or credit them against your future payments.
                <br>
            </li>
            <li>(e) <strong>Chargebacks.</strong> You are liable to the Company for any credit card chargebacks or
                related fees that the Company incurs on your account as a result of any billing disputes not first
                brought to the Company’s attention under section 10.3(d). If you fail to pay the Company for any
                chargeback or related fees no later than 30 days after the Company’s initial demand for payment, you
                will pay the Company $100 in additional liquidated damages, plus any costs the Company incurs for each
                chargeback or related fee.
                <br>
            </li>
            <li>(f) <strong>No Refunds.</strong> The Company considers all purchases final when made, except that the
                Company may approve a refund in the form of a credit on request if exceptional circumstances exist. If
                you believe exceptional circumstances exist, please email the Company at <a
                    href="mailto:support@virtualfashion.io" class="a-underline">support@virtualfashion.io</a> and
                explain the
                circumstances that you
                believe merits a refund. The Company is not making any promise that it will offer a refund. If the
                Company provides a refund, the Company will issue that refund in the form of a credit to the payment
                method you used for your purchase. The Company will not make refunds in the form of cash, check, or free
                services. The provision of a refund in one instance does not entitle you to a refund in the future for
                similar instances; nor does it obligate the Company to provide refunds in the future under any
                circumstance.
                <br>
            </li>
            <li>(g) <strong>Cancellation.</strong> You may cancel your premium membership at any time, and you will
                continue to have access to the Website through the end of your membership term. The Company does not
                provide refunds or credits for any partial-month membership periods. To cancel your premium membership,
                please contact the payment processor that you signed up through or email us at <a
                    href="mailto:support@virtualfashion.io" class="a-underline">support@virtualfashion.io</a>.</li>

                a loss (including fees for legal counsel, expert witnesses, and other advisers). A loss can be tangible
                or intangible; can arise from bodily injury, property damage, or other causes; can be based on tort,

                money damages in connection with the claim.
                <br>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Recovery of Expenses.</strong> In any proceedings between the parties arising out of or relating
                to the Website or this agreement, the prevailing party will be entitled to recover from the other party,
                besides any other relief awarded, all expenses that the prevailing party incurs in those proceedings,
                including legal fees and expenses. For purposes of this section 19.3, “prevailing party” means, for any
                proceeding, the party in whose favor an award is rendered, except that if in those proceedings the award
                finds in favor of one party on one or more claims or counterclaims and in favor of the other party on
                one or more other claims or counterclaims, neither party will be the prevailing party. If any
                proceedings are voluntarily dismissed or are dismissed as part of a settlement, neither party will be
                the prevailing party in those proceedings.
                <br>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Jury Trial Waiver.</strong> Each party waives its right to a jury trial in proceedings arising
                out of or relating to this agreement. Either party may enforce this waiver up to and including the first
                day of trial.
                <br>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Class Action Waiver.</strong> All claims must be brought in the parties’ individual capacity,
                and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding, and, unless
                the Company agrees otherwise, the arbitrator will not consolidate more than one person’s claims. Both
                parties acknowledge that each party is waiving the right to participate in a class action.
                Limitation on Time to Bring Claims. A party will not bring a claim arising out of or relating to the
                Website or this agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Any claim brought after
                one year is barred.</li>
