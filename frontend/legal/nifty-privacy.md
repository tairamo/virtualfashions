This exclusion applies regardless of theory of liability and even if you told the

Company or it knew or should have known about the possibility of damages.
If you are dissatisfied with the Website or have any other complaint, your exclusive remedy is to stop using the Website. The Company’s maximum liability to you for any claim will not exceed the greater of $250 and the amount you have paid to the Company for the applicable purchase out of which liability arose even if the remedy fails of its essential purpose.

> #### 16. Scope of Disclaimers, Exclusions, and Limits.
>
> The disclaimers, exclusions, and limits stated in sections 13, 14, and 15 apply to the greatest extent allowed by law, but no more. The Company does not intend to deprive you of any mandatory protections provided to you by law. Because some jurisdictions may prohibit the disclaimer of some warranties, the exclusion of some damages, or other matters, one or more of the disclaimers, exclusions, or limits will not apply to you.

> #### 17. Indemnification
>
> 1. **In General.** You will pay the Company, its directors, officers, employees, agents, contractors, subsidiaries, affiliates, licensors, content providers, and service providers (the “Indemnified Parties”) for any loss of an Indemnified Party that is caused by any of the following: (a) your access of or conduct on the Website; (b) your breach of this agreement; (c) your violation of rights of any person, including intellectual property, publicity, and privacy rights; (d) your violation of any applicable law; (e) your tortious acts or omissions; or (f) your criminal acts or omissions. But you are not required to pay if the loss was caused by the Indemnified Party’s intentional misconduct.
>    <br>
> 2. **Definitions**
>
> - (a) **“Loss”** means an amount that the Indemnified Party is legally responsible for or pays in any form. Amounts include, for example, a judgment, a settlement, a fine, damages, injunctive relief, staff compensation, a decrease in property value, and expenses for defending against a claim for a loss (including fees for legal counsel, expert witnesses, and other advisers). A loss can be tangible or intangible; can arise from bodily injury, property damage, or other causes; can be based on tort, breach of contract, or any other theory of recovery; and includes incidental, direct, and consequential damages.
>   <br>
> - (a) A loss is **“caused by”** an event if the loss would not have happened without the event, even if the event is not a proximate cause of the loss.
>   <br>
>
> 3. **Indemnified Party’s Duty to Notify.** The Indemnified Party will notify you before the 30th day after the Indemnified Party knows or should reasonably have known of a claim for a loss that you might be compelled to pay. But the Indemnified Party’s failure to timely notify you does not end your obligation, except if that failure prejudices your ability to defend or mitigate losses.
>    <br>
> 4. **Legal Defense of a Claim.** The Indemnified Party has control over defending a claim for a loss (including settling it) unless the Indemnified Party directs you to control the defense. If the Indemnified Party directs you to control the defense, you will not settle any litigation without the Indemnified Party’s written consent if the settlement (1) imposes a penalty or limitation on the Indemnified Party, (2) admits the Indemnified Party’s fault, or (3) does not fully release the Indemnified Party from liability. You and the Indemnified Party will cooperate in good faith on a claim.
>    <br>
> 5. **No Exclusivity.** The Indemnified Parties’ rights under this section 17 do not affect other rights they might have.

> #### 18. Governing Law; Place for Resolving Disputes
>
> 1. Delaware law governs all matters arising out of or relating to the Website or this agreement without giving effect to any conflicts of law principles. This agreement’s predominant purpose is providing services and licensing access to intellectual property and not a “sale of goods.” The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not govern this agreement, the application of which is expressly excluded.
>    <br>
> 2. Except for disputes subject to arbitration, all disputes arising out of or relating to the Website or this agreement will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the United States District Court for the District of Delaware or any state court in New Castle County, Delaware. Each party hereby submits to the personal jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the District of Delaware and the state courts in New Castle County, Delaware, to resolve all disputes not subject to arbitration. Each party hereby waives any right to seek another forum or venue because of improper or inconvenient forum.
>    <br>
> 3. For purposes of this section 18, the Website will be deemed solely based in the state of Delaware and will be deemed a passive website that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over the Company, either specific or general, in any other jurisdiction.

> #### 19. Alternative Dispute Resolution
>
> 1. **Arbitration.** As the exclusive means of initiating adversarial proceedings to resolve any dispute arising out of or relating to the Website or this agreement, a party may demand that any such dispute be resolved by arbitration administered by the Arbitration Resolution Services, Inc. (ARS) (or a similar online dispute resolution provider if ARS is not available) under its rules available at www.arbresolutions.com, and each party hereby consents to any such dispute being so resolved. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, will have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, enforceability, or formation of this agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this agreement is void or voidable. Each party will be responsible for paying any filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration. The arbitrator may grant whatever relief that would be available in a court at law or in equity, except that the arbitrator must not award punitive or exemplary damages, or damages otherwise limited or excluded in this agreement. The arbitrator’s award will include costs of arbitration, reasonable legal fees under section 19.3, and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses. Judgment on any award rendered in any such arbitration may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. Unless required by law, neither a party nor an arbitrator will disclose the existence, content, or results of any arbitration under this agreement without the parties’ prior written consent.
>    <br>
> 2. **Injunctive Relief.** The parties acknowledge that breach by either party of the obligations under this agreement could cause irreparable harm for which damages would be an inadequate remedy. Nothing in this section 19 will prevent either party from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts for matters related to data security, intellectual property, or unauthorized access to the Website, in each case without posting a bond or other security and without proof of actual money damages in connection with the claim.
>    <br>
> 3. **Recovery of Expenses.** In any proceedings between the parties arising out of or relating to the Website or this agreement, the prevailing party will be entitled to recover from the other party, besides any other relief awarded, all expenses that the prevailing party incurs in those proceedings, including legal fees and expenses. For purposes of this section 19.3, “prevailing party” means, for any proceeding, the party in whose favor an award is rendered, except that if in those proceedings the award finds in favor of one party on one or more claims or counterclaims and in favor of the other party on one or more other claims or counterclaims, neither party will be the prevailing party. If any proceedings are voluntarily dismissed or are dismissed as part of a settlement, neither party will be the prevailing party in those proceedings.
>    <br>
> 4. **Jury Trial Waiver.** Each party waives its right to a jury trial in proceedings arising out of or relating to this agreement. Either party may enforce this waiver up to and including the first day of trial.
>    <br>
> 5. **Class Action Waiver.** All claims must be brought in the parties’ individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding, and, unless the Company agrees otherwise, the arbitrator will not consolidate more than one person’s claims. Both parties acknowledge that each party is waiving the right to participate in a class action.
>    Limitation on Time to Bring Claims. A party will not bring a claim arising out of or relating to the Website or this agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Any claim brought after one year is barred.
